When I was doing the lesson first time, I make some mistake the following:
    I was not familiar with shell script, the logic is wrong on bool judge.
    Github push: first, I create a repository in the Github. then I init local directory. When I finish my homework, then I push to the repository, I found it could'nt . I search for unrelate. Because of I create two different repositories. So if I want to push to the repository, I need to pull by --allow-unrelated-histories. So it resolve.
